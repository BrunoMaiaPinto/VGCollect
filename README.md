This script processes a CSV file containing video game collection data. It performs the following tasks:

Read Data: The script reads the input CSV file (collection-2025-03-05.csv) containing information about video game names and their corresponding platforms.
Process Data: It iterates through the rows of the CSV file, formats the data, and stores it in a list.
Export to CSV: The script generates a new CSV file (cvsCollection.csv) that contains the processed data, with headers 'Index', 'Jogo', and 'Consola'.
Export to Excel: It also creates an Excel file (excelVgCollection.xlsx) containing the processed data, which is saved in a sheet named 'welcome'.
This allows for quick conversion of the video game collection data from CSV to both CSV and Excel formats, which is ideal for easy data management and analysis.
